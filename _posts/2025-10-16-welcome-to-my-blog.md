This is a sample post to showcase the new, modern feed style. Posts will be concise, practical, and focused on signal over noise.

- Crypto: on-chain flows, funding markets, and liquidity regimes
- Macro: growth, inflation, policy, and cross-asset narratives
- Quant: systematic edges, risk, and execution

Expect a mix of quick notes, deeper dives, and occasional charts. If you like the new format, share feedback so I can tune cadence and topics.
