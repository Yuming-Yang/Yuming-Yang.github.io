Place Inter variable font here as `Inter-Variable.woff2`.

Recommended source: https://github.com/rsms/inter/releases (download Inter Variable woff2)

The site preloads `/assets/fonts/Inter-Variable.woff2` and defines `@font-face` in `_includes/head.html`.
If absent, system fonts will be used as fallback.
